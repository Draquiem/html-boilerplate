    <h1>Links</h1>

    <p>This example is about links and <a href="Images.html"
        target="_blank">images</a>.</p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute Links, like to <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
            target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
        <p>Most detailed way you can refer to a webresource. They start with the "scheme" (Typically http:// or https://), followed by the domain name of the website, then path of the target web page.</p>
        <li>Relative Links, like to our <a href="./Extras.html"
            target="_blank">extras page</a>.</li>
        <p>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to use right now.</p>
    </ul>
